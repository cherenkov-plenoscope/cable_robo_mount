# The Robo Mount
a gigantic mount for the Atmospheric Cherenkov Plenoscope (ACP) that can actually be build

### Working together
The [ETH Institute for Particle Physics](http://www.ipp.phys.ethz.ch/) explores together with the [ETH Department for Civil Engineering](https://www.baug.ethz.ch/en/) the possibilites to build nothing less but the most powerfull cosmic gamma ray observatory ever planned.

From the first drafts

to the first concepts for an implementation...

### Simulating the mount
Advanced finite element simulation tools from civil engineering are combined with [scinetific ray tracing tools](https://github.com/TheBigLebowSky/mctracer) from particle physics. Together, the mechanical structure of the novel robo mount is investigated using the optical performance as a feedback.
